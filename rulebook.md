All participants must be in the **Lyfin's Tavern Discord** at the time of signup for your entry to be counted. Event registration may be canceled or modified by contacting an organizer.
 
## Game Client Version

Every match in the tournament will use the **latest version of Eternal Return**. If there is an update during the tournament period, the updated version will be immediately available for tournament use.
 
## New Character Releases

The latest character released is subject to being blocked from use based on the organizer’s decision. Generally, if a character is unavailable in ranked, they will be disabled in the tournament as well.
 
## Player Broadcast Guidelines

Players are allowed to stream the tournament from their own perspective but must match the delay (2 minute delay). Players streaming with less delay will be asked to increase their delay for the sake of all other participants in their group. Failure to do so will be met with heavy consequences. 

## Third-Party Tools

If the organizers recommend the players to use specific third-party tools (Discord, etc) the players should follow the organizers’ decision. All entrants of this Tournament must join the Lyfin Discord Server in order to receive news and communicate with the tournament staff.

## Account Ownership

The player must own a Steam account to participate in the tournament. If the associated Eternal Return account is currently or has been previously banned By Nimble Neuron, the player will not be allowed to play in the tournament. The duration of tournament suspensions will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Using an alternate account to try and circumvent a ban will result in immediate disqualification. Teammates of a banned player will also be punished for helping to circumvent a ban. Account sharing is not allowed. Players may not play on another user’s account under any circumstances. All disputes over account ownership will be investigated and handled by the organizers.

## Substitute Players

Currently, no substitute players are allowed to join. But a team can still replace a member at most **2 days** before the tournament starts by reporting to the tournament organizers beforehand (pereferrable to Zibub or Mizyx). If any team member is unable to play by the time the tournament starts, the team has the option to forfeit or play with an incomplete team.

## In-game Nicknames

Players cannot use nicknames that include sexual, political, or offensive words or phrases. Players using inappropriate nicknames will be asked to change their nickname or be disqualified from the tournament. or asked to change their nickname. Players should use the same nickname that they submitted in the registration form. If not, they will not be allowed to participate.

## Sportsmanship

All players should be familiar with all rules and guidelines in this rulebook. Players must give their best effort in the tournament. Players may not drop from an on-going set of games due to poor performance. Players should also follow the tournament staffs’ instructions and accept any final decisions made by referees or organizers. Treat all fellow players and tournament staff with respect.

## Rehost

Failure to start a match caused by server problems, natural disasters, or specific technical problems can result in a rehost of the lobby. If the game is to be rehosted, all players MUST maintain the same character picks, main augment, and tac skill. Rehosts will also sometimes occur in the case of player disconnections, according to section [Disconnect during Online Match] [Failure to do so will be subjected to -1 points for each rule broken]

> **Example**: **Player A** retains the same character pick but fails to pick the same previously selected **Main Augment**, therefore **-1 points** will be deducted. If both options are picked wrongly, **-2 points** will be deducted.

### Weather Settings
> In the case of rehosting, weather settings will be manually set to follow the weather of the remade round (not re-randomised).

### Disconnect during In Game

Unintentional disconnects or crashes occurring during the loading screen or within the first 30 seconds of game start may result in a rehost. For player-side issues, **up to 1 lobby rehosts per team can be offered as a courtesy**. If any member of the team cannot play the game normally after that, the match will proceed normally. Make sure you put the game to “SSD drive” to smoothen the whole tournament.

### Disconnect during Match Preparation

If a player experiences an unintentional disconnect during joining to the lobby, but expects to be able to reconnect, they will be given 3 minutes to join the lobby before the match proceeds normally. In any game modes, the game will proceed normally while the disconnected party will have disadvantage of their own risk.

## Multi Pick Ban Rule

This rule restricts any character to be played for the next 2 rounds for all teams. If a character has been pick by 3 or more players, **all participants is no longer allowed to pick that character for the next two rounds.**.

> If a character is picked after it is restricted, the lobby will be **rehosted** using that team's rehost chance and a **-1 points** penalty will be given; if that team no longer has a rehost chance, the lobby will still be rehosted and a **-3 points** penalty will be given. If this is done a second time, a **-10 points** penalty will be given resulting in **disqualification** (see **Penalty Limit** for details).

## Unfair Play

The following behaviors are categorized as unfair play and will be penalized. Players may report another player’s violation of rules if they have proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and a penalty will be determined. The default penalty is a 1-round forfeit if there is no exact penalty specified. All decisions are made at the discretion of the tournament organizers.

> **No-shows**: All players must check in and join the game lobby and the designated Discord voice channel (if applicable) on time. If they fail to join on time, they will be disqualified from the tournament. 1st offense – disqualification from current tournament.
> 
> **Teaming**: Teaming is strictly prohibited in all modes. If multiple teams or players collude to gain an unfair advantage, all teams or players will be disqualified from the tournament. This will be applied if multiple teams or players avoid dealing damage to each other while staying in combat range. Rulings on teaming will be handled on a case-by-case basis by organizers. 1st offense – disqualification from current tournament.
> 
> **Outside communication**: Communication with anyone outside of your team in the case of squads or duos is not allowed during the tournament.

For first offense, the rehost chance of that team will be used to remake the lobby and a -2 points penalty will be given. If repeated, a -10 points penalty will be given which results in disqualification.
> 
> **Dying in a restricted area/Quitting**: Dying in the restricted area or quitting the match while alive even if the player is not in combat is strongly discouraged. All points from a player’s death will be given to the player or team that most clearly forced the player’s death to occur. Some situations will be case to case basis so it will be decided by the organizers.
